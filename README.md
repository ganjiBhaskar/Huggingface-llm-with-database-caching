# Efficient Query Handling with LLM and Database Caching

## Overview
This system optimizes the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) by caching responses in a database. When a user asks a question, the system follows these steps:

1. **Check the Database**: If an answer to the question is already stored, retrieve it from the database.
2. **Query the LLM**: If the answer is not found in the database, fetch the response from the LLM.
3. **Store the Answer**: Save the LLM-generated answer in the database for future queries.
4. **Return the Response**: Deliver the answer to the user, either from the database or the LLM.

## Benefits
- **Reduces API Costs**: Minimizes repeated calls to the LLM, reducing API usage costs.
- **Improves Response Time**: Fetching stored answers from the database is faster than querying the LLM.
- **Enhances System Efficiency**: Optimized workflow for frequently asked questions.

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up a database to store question-answer pairs.
2. Implement logic to check the database before querying the LLM.
3. Store new responses from the LLM into the database.
4. Retrieve answers from the database when the same question is asked again.

This approach ensures a balance between performance and cost efficiency while leveraging LLM capabilities effectively.
